This utility.exe allows you to enter the name of a file and automatically remove
spaces from it and provide it a file number.

If you check off file autocreation, the program still spits out your modified file
name on output, and also saves created file names in
utility--remove-space-file-name--add-file-number__file-name-list.txt

For latest version:
1. Copy utility--remove-space-file-name--add-file-number.exe in any folder
2. Run the exe
3. Enjoy!

Or, compile the utility--remove-space-file-name--add-file-number.cpp file
to get your own executable.

It's relatively easy to modify this procedure to automatically create
file names in any other language, if you wanna

In the C++ file, on line 33, simply replace the ".cpp"
with whatever file format you wish to automatically create, like ".c" for c

Remember, if you wanna modify the C++ file, you may have to drag along
the ActiveCombat header file for certain versions.

It automatically removes ending leading whitespace as well, so just paste in your results!

// For previous versions:
// Put run.cpp in the parent folder of utility__pkg.
// Place the generated executable in the place you want files created.


// Run.cpp was meant to be able to create an executable that could access exe
// utility.exe file from the parent folder, but this leaves the exe less versatile

// ActiveCombat contains debugging methods and macros for the project

// utility--remove-space-file-name--add-file-numberError.txt contains errors
